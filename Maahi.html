        <h3>Preserve water, preserve life:</h3>
        <pre>     
            Water is the basic necessity of all life forms,whether
            it be humans, plants, or animals.Wateris a crucial part
            of our lives, without which life cannot sustain.Over 
            the years, we have learnt a lot about the importance
            of water and that we should use it judicially. Humans
            have suggested many techniques to save water, but these
            are never practiced.The reason behind this is the lack 
            of understanding and ignorance. Some so many people have
            not yet understood the value of water and the need to save it.

            Even by saving a single drop of water in one day, we can 
            save tonnes of water all over the world. The oceans were
            never formed in one day; drop by drop, each day, these 
            large oceans were formed.
        
            Similarly, if we take the initiative to save only one drop
            of water, it can cause a massive change. All we need to do
            is make a move.

            According to a survey, by 2050, India will be amongst
            the countries which will face acute water shortage.
            It is an alarming situation as, concerning the population
            in our country, water shortage would significantly impact 
            the country. Not only this, but people would also start 
            fighting and killing each other for water.
